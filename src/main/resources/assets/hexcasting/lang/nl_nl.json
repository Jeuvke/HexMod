Actions are what actually $(italic)do/$ the magic; all patterns influence _media in particular ways, and when those influences end up doing something useful, we call it an action.$(br2)_Media can be fickle: if I draw an invalid pattern, I'll get some garbage result somewhere on my stack (read on...)",
  "hexcasting.page.1014header": "An Example",
  "hexcasting.page.1014": "It's interesting to note that the $(italic)rotation/$ of a pattern doesn't seem to matter at all. These two patterns both perform the $(l:patterns/basics#hexcasting:get_caster)$(action)Mind's Reflection/$, for example.",

  "hexcasting.page.1019": "Of course, there's no such thing as a free lunch. All spells, and certain other actions, require _media as payment.$(br2)The best I can figure, a _Hex is a little bit like a plan of action presented to Nature-- in this analogy, the _media is used to provide the arguments to back it up, so Nature will accept your plan and carry it out.",
  "hexcasting.page.10110": "That aside, it doesn't seem like anyone has done much research on exactly how $(italic)much/$ any particular piece of amethyst is valued.

I suspect that whole blocks or crystals are too solid to be easily unraveled into _media.",
  "hexcasting.page.10111": "It's also worth noting that each action will consume the _media it needs immediately, rather than all at once when the Hex finishes. Also, an action will always consume entire items-- an action that only requires one $(item)Amethyst Dust/$'s worth of _media will consume an entire $(item)Charged Amethyst Crystal/$, if that's all that's present in my inventory.$(br2)Thus, it might be a good idea to bring dust for spellcasting too-- waste not, want not...",
  "hexcasting.page.10112": "I should also be careful to make sure I actually have enough Amethyst in my inventory-- if not, it seems Nature is happy to use my own mind as payment instead.

  "hexcasting.page.influences3": "Finally, there is an influence, or perhaps infinite family of influences, that seem to just be a tangled mess of _media.
